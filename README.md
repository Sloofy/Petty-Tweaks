# Petty-Tweaks
A tweaked version of the default TF2 HUD. This project is incomplete currently and is done in my spare time.

# Why?
Team Fortress 2's default HUD is pretty thematic to the game's setting, and most custom HUDs tend to minimize on the details for sake of clarity. Those HUDs are great, but why not make the default HUD a bit better by tweaking it a bit? Hence, petty tweaks.

# Installation
On all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), you can install this HUD by right-clicking on the game in the Steam library, going into 'Properties' > 'Local Files' > 'Browse Local Files...', and then you should be in the file explorer for your OS. Now in the Team Fortress 2 folder, navigate your way through the folders 'tf' > 'custom' and place Petty-Tweaks there.

# Support
I'm flattered that you would ever want to donate to this project, but I really can't accept anything. All I'm doing here is making a few text file updates. If you decide you want to spend your money, however, may I suggest giving it to charity?
