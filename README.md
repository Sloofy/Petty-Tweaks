# Sloofy's Petty Tweaks
A tweaked version of the default TF2 HUD with the idea to keep with the theme of the game and providing better visual clarity. This project is currently incomplete and is done in my spare time.

While it tweaks the default HUD, it in no way is it supposed to act as a 1:1 replacement. It strips of some entry-level features that beginning players might need which advanced players may not depend on.

- Health and ammo counters are closer to the crosshair / centre of the screen
- The cycling ad on the main menu has been removed, and the friends list space has been increased
- The spectator view has been cleaned up
- Capture point objectives are smaller
- Chat is in a (debatably) less obstructive space
- More to change soon. Feedback is welcome!

# Why?
Team Fortress 2's default HUD is pretty thematic to the game's setting, and most custom HUDs tend to minimize on the details for sake of clarity. Those HUDs are great, but why not make the default HUD a bit better by tweaking it a bit? Hence, here be a number of petty tweaks.

# Installation
On all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), you can install this HUD by right-clicking on the game in the Steam library, going into 'Properties' > 'Local Files' > 'Browse Local Files...', and then you should be in the file explorer for your OS. Now in the Team Fortress 2 folder, navigate your way through the folders 'tf' > 'custom' and place Petty-Tweaks there.

# Support
I'm flattered that you would ever want to donate to such a project, but I really can't accept anything. All I'm doing here is making a few text file updates. If you decide you want to spend your money, however, might I suggest giving it to charity? How about, [Direct Relief?](https://www.directrelief.org/)
